Since a while, a huge qualm I had with the official Protobuf/gRPC tooling for Python has been resolved.
There wasn't any IDE support for the stubs generated by the Protobuf compiler, making development tedious and error-prone.

For this reason, I had switched to [betterproto](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/python-betterproto),
which creates significantly prettier, pythonic and type-hinted code. Unfortunately, it is also lacking a few features, and comes at the expense of
[performance](https://github.com/jdvor/pbwhy) which in the official tooling is achieved by using C(++) modules (which cause the ugly generated code).

Fortunately, type hinting for the official tooling is possible using [types-protobuf](https://pypi.org/project/types-protobuf/).

All you have to do is install it alongside gPRC/Protobuf:
```
pip install grpcio-tools mypy-protobuf types-protobuf
```

And then you can instruct `protoc` to generate `mypy` type hints alongside the generated code:
```
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I./lib/protos --python_out=./lib/grpc --grpc_python_out=./lib/grpc --mypy_out=./lib/grpc lib/protos/*
```

For example in PyCharm these will be picked up and used automatically, making development a lot easier.

One thing that it cannot do is add type hints to the parameters of the gRPC stub methods, so when you implement those, I would recommend adding the appropriate
type hint right away so

```python
async def SomeRpcCall(self, request, context):
  ...
```
becomes:

```
async def SomeRpcCall(self, request: SomeRpcCallRequest, context) -> SomeRpcCallResponse:
```

Hope this helps!
